    "- The backpropagation algorithm works by going from the output layer to the input layer, propagating the error gradient on the way. \n",
    "- Once the gradient for each parameter is calculated, the gradients are used to update each parameter. \n",
    "- **However** gradients get smaller and smaller as the algorithm progresses to the lower layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to this vanishing gradient, the weights and biases of the lower layers stay unchanged. \n",

    "\n",
    "**The opposite can happen too**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In some cases, the gradient gets bigger when moving to lower layers, hence the lower layers end up getting large weight updates and the algorithm diverges. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a general sense, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients throughout the network resulting in different layers learning at different speeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Issues which contribute to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combination of logistic sigmoid activation function and the weight initialization technique (Random initialization using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard dev. of 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looking at the sigmoid activation function, it saturates at large positive and negative inputs and the function saturates at 0 and 1. At these saturated positions, the gradient is close to zero and hence cannot back propagate through a network. Hence there is not enough to be backpropagated to lower layers.\n",
